# ðŸ“¦Moving Average+ Methods

The MovingAveragePlus class abstracts the implementation of a circular array in order to calculate the arithmetic average of its members.
Because it is a circular array, the next input will replace the oldest element (represented by the first index), so it is also possible to call it a FIFO queue.

If you are used to the C++ Standard Library, it will be easier to learn the methods since they follow the same pattern of name and logic.

If you are looking for calculating a shorter average of the same data array more efficiently, check the new feature, [Partials](pathname:///docs/class-methods/partials/intro).
